Name : James Mach
Help : Simon Reisig helped with debugging when I was having errors, and the c++ documentation
Time : 4-5 hours
Other : It took me longer than I expected because this is my first time using c++.
        This project aslo helped me get a lot more comfortable with c++.
        For my solution i used a vector and indexed it as if it were multidimensional.
